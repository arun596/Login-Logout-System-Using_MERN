I developed a Login and Logout System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) 
with secure user authentication. The system allows users to register, log in, and log out using JWT (JSON Web Token)
authentication and bcrypt.js for password hashing.
The frontend, built with React, provides a responsive UI, 
while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, manages authentication logic and securely stores user





credentials in MongoDB using Mongoose. Protected routes ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages.
The system follows RESTful API principles, with smooth API calls handled by Axios. 
This project demonstrates my ability to implement authentication, manage user sessions, and integrate secure login functionalities in a full-stack web application. ðŸš€
